# RTF 1.21.1 Branch Split Plan

Date: 2026-06-23

## Objective

Keep the current `1.21.1` branch as the integrated working branch with everything it already has.
Create separate topic branches from the current upstream `upstream/1.21.1` tip so each topic can
become a distinct PR. Each split branch should carry only the commits or manual changes needed for
its topic, build clean QA jars, and be independently QA-able.

Current upstream base:

```text
f870c45 upstream/1.21.1 Merge pull request #88 from ETcodehome/addCommunityPreset1
```

Current integrated branch:

```text
f945636 1.21.1 Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/1.21.1' into 1.21.1
```

## Target Branches

```text
fix/tall-world-mountain-scaling
fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling
feat/configurable-strata
feat/configurable-shorelines
```

Classification notes:

- `fix/tall-world-mountain-scaling` is a fix branch even if it includes the config/plumbing needed
  to make tall-world behavior usable.
- `fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling` is a fix branch even if it includes user-facing ocean-depth
  config/UI, because the behavior being corrected is ocean floors respecting configured depth/world
  depth in tall worlds.
- `feat/configurable-strata` is feature work. Deepslate is not separately configurable; its band is
  dynamic from `worldDepth` plus strata rock layer counts, so it should travel with this branch
  without being named separately.
- `feat/configurable-shorelines` is feature work: shore classification, material palettes,
  continuity, and raw-generation beach surface painting.

## Key Existing Commits

```

Important: `fe1ef47` combines two topics: configurable ocean depth and configurable strata. It
should not be blindly cherry-picked into both `fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling` and
`feat/configurable-strata`; split it manually by file/hunk.

## Recommended Work Order

1. `feat/configurable-shorelines`
2. `fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling`
3. `feat/configurable-strata`
4. `fix/tall-world-mountain-scaling`

Rationale:

- Shorelines are the broadest foundational feature and introduce `WorldSettings.Beach`.
- Deeper oceans modify `WorldSettings.Ocean`, `Levels`, ocean populators, and world settings UI.
- Strata shares translation/UI files with deeper oceans and shares surface-rule files with
  shoreline-generated beach surfaces, so it benefits from knowing which branch owns which hunks.
- Tall-world mountain scaling touches density projection and many common world-height helpers. It
  should be prepared after the ocean/depth split is clear, because `ba51215` depends on the
  tall-world projection code from this area.

## Branch Plans

### Branch: `feat/configurable-shorelines`

Base:

```bash
git switch --detach upstream/1.21.1
git switch -c feat/configurable-shorelines
```

Likely source commits:

```text
33687b8
b902464
317396f
ebb7f1d
```

Expected contents:

- `cell/beach/*`
- `BeachSurfaceFeature`
- beach surface feature registration
- `WorldSettings.Beach` hierarchy
- `Cell` shore metadata fields
- river/lake shore field emission
- `BeachDetect` evaluator pass
- `WorldLookup` sampled fallback/evaluator support

Expected conflicts/manual checks:

- `WorldSettings.java`: upstream now includes optional codec changes for island control points. Keep
  upstream optional defaults and add optional `beaches`.
- `Presets.java`: upstream includes the new Community preset. Shoreline branch should not remove or
  rewrite it.
- No translation conflict should be needed unless later UI/config is included by accident.

Build gate:

```bash
sh ./gradlew clean build
```

QA focus:

- ocean beach material painting
- river shore and lake/wetland shore material painting
- continuity around broken/coarse ocean shoreline cells
- fallback `WorldLookup` behavior when tile cache is absent

### Branch: `fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling`

Base:

```bash
git switch --detach upstream/1.21.1
git switch -c fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling
```

Do not cherry-pick all of `fe1ef47`. Manually extract the ocean/depth hunks only.

Source hunks from:

```text
fe1ef47 Add configurable ocean depth and strata
ba51215 Allow deep oceans below zero in tall worlds
```

Expected contents from `fe1ef47`:

- `WorldSettings.Ocean` fields:
  - `shallowOceanDepth`
  - `deepOceanMinDepth`
  - `deepOceanMaxDepth`
  - `oceanDepthNoiseScale`
- `WorldSettings.Beach.DEFAULT` ocean constructor/default updates if this branch is based after
  shoreline.
- `Levels` support for `worldDepth` and `min`.
- `GeneratorContext` constructing `Levels(terrain/world height, worldDepth, seaLevel)` as needed.
- `Heightmap.make()` passing ocean settings into `Populators.makeDeepOcean` / `makeShallowOcean`.
- `Populators.makeDeepOcean` and `makeShallowOcean` using configured ocean depths.
- `OceanPopulator` allowing negative ocean floors down to a supplied minimum.
- `WorldSettingsPage` ocean depth sliders.
- `RTFTranslationKeys`, `RTFLanguageProvider`, and `en_us.json` ocean labels/tooltips.

Expected contents from `ba51215`:

- `PresetNoiseRouterData.tallTerrainOffset(...)` lower clamp uses configured world bottom:

```java
double minProjectedHeight = -properties.worldDepth / (double) terrainModelHeight;
```

Dependency warning:

- `ba51215` depends on the tall-world density projection code introduced by the tall-world branch.
  If `fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling` is meant to build independently from upstream, either:
  - include the minimal projection code needed by `ba51215`, or
  - leave the below-zero tall-world projection fix for a separate `fix/oceans-respect-world-depth`
    branch based on `fix/tall-world-mountain-scaling`.

Expected conflicts/manual checks:

- `WorldSettings.java`: overlaps with shoreline branch's `WorldSettings.Beach`.
- `RTFTranslationKeys.java`: upstream added `GUI_COMMUNITY1_PRESET_NAME` and renamed
  `GUI_LABEL_TRANSITIONS`. Keep both upstream and ocean keys.
- `WorldSettingsPage.java`: keep upstream behavior and add only ocean-depth UI.
- Avoid bringing in `MiscellaneousSettings.StrataSettings` or `StrataRule` hunks from `fe1ef47`.

Build gate:

```bash
sh ./gradlew clean build
```

QA focus:

- shallow ocean slider changes actual shallow floor Y
- deep min/max depth sliders change deep ocean floor Y
- configured ocean floors can go below `Y=0` when `worldDepth` permits
- existing presets without new ocean depth fields load

### Branch: `feat/configurable-strata`

Base:

```bash
git switch --detach upstream/1.21.1
git switch -c feat/configurable-strata
```

Do not cherry-pick all of `fe1ef47`. Manually extract strata hunks only, then apply deepslate
follow-up.

Source hunks from:

```text
fe1ef47 Add configurable ocean depth and strata
b612264 Fix TerraBlender deepslate surface rules
```

Expected contents from `fe1ef47`:

- `MiscellaneousSettings.StrataSettings`
- `StrataRule` layer thickness/material weighting changes
- `PresetSurfaceRuleData` strata setting propagation
- `MiscellaneousPage` strata sliders
- `RTFTranslationKeys`, `RTFLanguageProvider`, and `en_us.json` strata labels/tooltips

Expected contents from `b612264`:

- `PresetSurfaceRuleData` full overworld surface rule replacement with dynamic deepslate band.
- `PresetSurfaceRuleData.computeDeepslateBand(...)`.
- TerraBlender default surface rule registration in `MixinParameterList`.
- Guarded surface debug probe in `MixinSurfaceSystem`.
- `reterraforged.accesswidener` update for debug probe access.
- `DynamicOverworldSurfaceRule` and `RTFSurfaceRules` only if still needed by the selected
  implementation. Current docs say they are retained but unused; prefer omitting them if the branch
  builds and behavior stays correct without dead code.

Deepslate naming note:

- There are no separate deepslate sliders or explicit deepslate preset fields.
- Dynamic deepslate uses `worldDepth` plus `rockMinLayers` / `rockMaxLayers` to compute the band.
- Therefore this branch should be named around configurable strata, not configurable deepslate.

Expected conflicts/manual checks:

- `PresetSurfaceRuleData.java`: this will be a large manual reconciliation because shoreline, beach
  surface, strata, and deepslate can all touch generated features/surface rules.
- `RTFTranslationKeys.java`: keep upstream community preset key and transitions key; add strata
  keys.
- `RTFLanguageProvider.java`: merged branch currently lacks generated `GUI_COMMUNITY1_PRESET_NAME`
  in the provider even though `en_us.json` has it. Add it if datagen consistency matters on this
  branch.
- Do not bring ocean-depth fields/UI from `fe1ef47`.

Build gate:

```bash
sh ./gradlew clean build
```

QA focus:

- fewer/thicker strata bands based on `rockMinLayers` / `rockMaxLayers`
- material weighting makes stone more common without removing granite/andesite/diorite
- deepslate transition follows configured `worldDepth`
- TerraBlender active runtime no longer forces vanilla deepslate at `Y=0`
- vanilla-depth worlds still behave like vanilla deepslate banding

### Branch: `fix/tall-world-mountain-scaling`

Base:

```bash
git switch --detach upstream/1.21.1
git switch -c fix/tall-world-mountain-scaling
```

Source commit:

```text
70b53b5 Fix tall-world mountain scaling
```

Do not blindly cherry-pick the docs-only `agent-ref` files from the historical commit; `agent-ref`
is ignored now and should remain local.

Expected contents:

- explicit `terrainModelHeight()` split from configured `worldHeight`
- `terrainScaler()` retained as deprecated compatibility alias
- density projection changes in `PresetNoiseRouterData`
- `CellSampler.HEIGHT` declared range fix
- tall-world dynamic max height handling in `MixinNoiseBasedChunkGenerator`
- model-height usage in `GeneratorContext`, previews, terrain-type noise, surface noise
- mountain horizontal scaling based on `tallTerrainHorizontalScale()`
- `TerrainProvider` / `Populators` mountain scaling fixes
- optional guarded debug helper `WorldHeightDebug` and safe debug lookup in `MixinRandomState`

Expected conflicts/manual checks:

- `WorldSettings.java`: upstream optional codec changes plus branch terrain model helpers must
  coexist.
- `Heightmap.java`, `Populators.java`, and `TerrainProvider.java`: ensure mountain footprint scaling
  applies to all mountain layers, not only mountain chains.
- `PresetNoiseRouterData.java`: if this branch also needs below-zero ocean floors, include
  `ba51215`; otherwise leave that for an ocean follow-up branch.
- `Levels.java`: if started from plain upstream, decide whether `worldDepth/min` belongs here or
  only in tall-world ocean scaling. Tall-world projection itself may need `worldDepth` only for
  below-zero ocean behavior.

Build gate:

```bash
sh ./gradlew clean build
```

QA focus:

- 1024-height preset no longer caps mountains around the old 256-scale band
- mountains are not blade-like vertical walls
- ordinary hills/plains are not inflated to extreme heights
- same seed preserves broad continent/ocean/biome layout compared with pre-fix behavior

## Cross-Branch Risks

1. `fe1ef47` must be split manually.
   - Ocean and strata share translation files, GUI provider, `WorldSettings`, and generated JSON.
   - Use `git show fe1ef47 -- <file>` and apply selected hunks with `git apply --3way` or manual
     patches.

2. `WorldSettings.java` is the highest-conflict file.
   - Upstream optional island control point codecs must be kept.
   - Shorelines add `Beach`.
   - Deeper oceans add fields under `Ocean`.
   - Tall-world scaling adds `terrainModelHeight()` helpers.

3. `PresetSurfaceRuleData.java` is the highest-risk behavior file.
   - Strata/deepslate owns most surface rule changes.
   - Shoreline branch may need beach configured feature placement but should not own deepslate
     behavior.

4. Translation files will conflict repeatedly.
   - Always keep:
     - `GUI_COMMUNITY1_PRESET_NAME`
     - `GUI_LABEL_TRANSITIONS`
     - ocean depth keys when on ocean branch
     - strata keys when on strata branch
     - `GUI_LABEL_OCEAN` when ocean UI is present

5. Build success is necessary but not enough.
   - Most failures here are worldgen behavior failures. Each branch needs targeted QA in-game after
     the clean build.

## Execution Checklist Per Branch

For each branch:

1. Start clean.

   ```bash
   git status --short --branch
   ```

2. Create branch from upstream.

   ```bash
   git switch --detach upstream/1.21.1
   git switch -c <branch-name>
   ```

3. Apply commits/hunks.

4. Resolve conflicts with `rg -n '<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>' .`.

5. Build.

   ```bash
   sh ./gradlew clean build
   ```

6. Record jar paths/timestamps.

   ```bash
   find fabric/build/libs neoforge/build/libs -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.jar' \
     -printf '%TY-%Tm-%Td %TH:%TM:%TS %p\n' | sort
   ```

7. Commit with a focused message.

8. User QA.

## Open Decisions Before Execution

1. Use the user's proposed branch names exactly, or adopt the recommended corrected names.
2. Whether `fix/tall-world-ocean-scaling` should include the tall-world below-zero ocean fix
   (`ba51215`) directly, or whether that should become a dependent `fix/oceans-respect-world-depth`
   branch.
3. Whether to keep debug instrumentation (`WorldHeightDebug`, `MixinSurfaceSystem` probe) in
   feature/fix branches or strip it before PR-ready branches.
4. Whether to add `GUI_COMMUNITY1_PRESET_NAME` to `RTFLanguageProvider` during branch work for
   datagen consistency.
